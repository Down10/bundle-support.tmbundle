1.0
	- initial release

1.1 
	- added inputbox, standard-inputbox
	- textbox window no longer closes on escape unless there's a "Cancel" 
	  button
	- fixed error handling for textbox when --text-from-file file is
	  invalid.

1.1.1  April 26, 2004
	- starting to use x.y.z versioning (instead of x.y)
	- progressbar incorrectly printed error with --debug 
	  (runControlFromOptions: always returned nil, which should only happen 
	  on error).  This has been fixed.
	- progressbar character encoding bug fixed. should now properly handle
	  UTF8 labels read from stdin. see bug 942012 on sf.net page.  thanks to
	  J-F Boquillard for finding and fixing this.

1.1.2  May 10, 2004
	- fixed crash that would occur when printing return values containing 
	  non-Roman characters. Thanks to Nobumi Iyanaga for finding this.
	- added "debug" class method to CDControl and got rid of those 
	  printf()s.

1.1.3  May 11, 2004
	- fixed handling of multi-line input to progressbar.

1.2.0  Dec 28, 2004  
	- added dropdown and standard-dropdown controls.

1.2.1  Jan, 2005
        - added --no-show, --float, --timeout and --help options
	- turned into a background app so that the dialog icon does not show
	up in the menu bar. This, together with float, is very useful for
	loginhooks.

1.2.2  Nov, 2005
	- the progress bar won't show until a small delay has passed (so <1 seconds actions won't show a flashing window)
	- the progress bar use left-aligned label text which is only one line high, and the actual progress bar is set to use the small GUI style (to match the text)
	- CocoaDialog builds as a universal binary
	- buttons in the input box are now sized to fit and the minimum size of the window is set accordingly
	- label text in the input box is left-aligned and use the standard system font (instead of the small one) and is made only one line high (probably “sizeToFit” would make sense here)

	  button

	  invalid.

1.1.1  April 26, 2004
	- starting to use x.y.z versioning (instead of x.y)
	- progressbar incorrectly printed error with --debug 
	  (runControlFromOptions: always returned nil, which should only happen 
	  on error).  This has been fixed.

	  UTF8 labels read from stdin. see bug 942012 on sf.net page.  thanks to
	  J-F Boquillard for finding and fixing this.

	  printf()s.

        - added --no-show, --float, --timeout and --help options

	loginhooks.
